/**
 `TMMemoryCache` is a fast, thread safe key/value store similar to `NSCache`. On iOS it will clear itself
 automatically to reduce memory usage when the app receives a memory warning or goes into the background.

 Access is natively asynchronous. Every method accepts a callback block that runs on a concurrent
 <queue>, with cache writes protected by GCD barriers. Synchronous variations are provided.
 
 All access to the cache is dated so the that the least-used objects can be trimmed first. Setting an
 optional <ageLimit> will trigger a GCD timer to periodically to trim the cache to that age.
 
 Objects can optionally be set with a "cost", which could be a byte count or any other meaningful integer.
 Setting a <costLimit> will automatically keep the cache below that value with <trimToCostByDate:>.

 Values will not persist after application relaunch or returning from the background. See <TMCache> for
 a memory cache backed by a disk cache.
