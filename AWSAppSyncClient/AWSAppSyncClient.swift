    ///   - baseQuery: The base query to fetch which contains the primary data.
    ///   - baseQueryResultHandler: Closure that is called when base query results are available or when an error occurs. Every time a sync operation is called, a fetch for the baseQuery from the cache will be done first before initiating any other operations.

    ///   - syncConfiguration: The sync configuration where the baseQuery sync interval can be specified. (Defaults to 24 hours.)
    /// - Returns: An object that can be used to cancel the sync operation.
